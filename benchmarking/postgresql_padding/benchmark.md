# Benchmarking Untuned PostgreSQL with Column Padding Optimazation for an OLAP Use Case


## **Methodology**

We used **ClickBench PostgreSQL** ([GitHub](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/tree/main/postgresql)) for benchmarking.
ClickBench provides **43 queries** that test PostgreSQLâ€™s performance on:

- **Aggregations**
- **Text search**
- **Other OLAP-related queries**

However, we added these optimizations on this test

- Optimized `create.sql`:
    The create.sql file has been optimized using [column padding alignment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7431468) to improve table structure and ensure better data insertion performance.
- Updated `COPY` Command in `benchmark.sh`:
The COPY command in benchmark.sh now explicitly maps columns from the dataset to ensure proper alignment during data insertion.

## **Benchmark Machine Specifications**

The entire benchmark was run on a virtual machine with the following specifications:

| Component  | Specification  |
|------------|---------------|
| **CPU**    | 16 vCPUs      |
| **Memory** | 32 GB         |
| **Storage**| 500 GB        |

Since the data is present locally, networking details are omitted.

## **Results**

### **Table Size**

For **100 million rows**, PostgreSQL requires **67GB** of storage.

```sh
sudo du -hcs /var/lib/postgresql/14/main/
64G        /var/lib/postgresql/14/main/
64G        total
```

### **Insertion Time**

Without any parallel insertion, inserting the dataset takes **28 minutes**.

```
0.87 user 
73.92 system 
28:05.97 elapsed
```

### **Indexing**

- **Indexing time:** `0s` (No indexing applied)
- **Index Size:** `0GB` (No indexes created)

### **Query Performance**
