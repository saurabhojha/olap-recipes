In BRIN (Block Range INdex) indexes, an "opclass" (operator class) defines how the index should handle data types and operations. It specifies a set of functions and operators that are used to index and query specific data types. Each opclass supports different strategies for summarizing and comparing values within block ranges.

### BRIN Opclasses
BRIN indexes have several opclasses, each tailored for different types of operations:

1. **Min/Max Opclass**:
   - **Function**: Summarizes a range of values using the minimum and maximum values.
   - **Operations**: Efficiently supports range queries like `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>=`, `>`.
   - **Code Example**: [brin_minmax.c](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/brin/brin_minmax.c)

2. **Bloom Filter Opclass**:
   - **Function**: Summarizes a range of values using a Bloom filter, which allows efficient testing of value presence.
   - **Operations**: Primarily supports equality operations.
   - **Source Code**: [brin_bloom.c](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/brin/brin_bloom.c)

3. **Inclusion Opclass**:
   - **Function**: Summarizes ranges by indicating whether certain values are included within the range.
   - **Operations**: Supports range and inclusion queries.
   - **Source Code**: [brin_inclusion.c](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/brin/brin_inclusion.c)

4. **Min/Max Multi Opclass**:
   - **Function**: An extension of the Min/Max opclass that supports multiple value ranges within a single block range.
   - **Operations**: Similar to Min/Max but allows for more complex range handling.
   - **Source Code**: [brin_minmax_multi.c](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/brin/brin_minmax_multi.c)

### Commonalities and Differences
- **Commonalities**:
  - All BRIN opclasses use the same basic structure and interfaces for defining and interacting with the index.
  - They all implement the necessary support functions such as `opcinfo`, `add_value`, `consistent`, and `union`.
  - They are designed to be space-efficient and work within the constraints of BRIN indexing, which is to summarize data over large block ranges.

- **Differences**:
  - **Summarization Strategy**: Each opclass uses a different strategy to summarize the data. For example, Min/Max uses the minimum and maximum values, while Bloom uses hash values in a Bloom filter.
  - **Supported Operations**: Depending on the summarization strategy, the operations they support can vary. Min/Max is good for range queries, while Bloom is optimized for equality checks.
  - **Implementation Details**: Each opclass has specific implementation details tailored to its summarization strategy. For example, the Bloom opclass includes hashing mechanisms and false positive rate management.

Overall, BRIN opclasses provide flexibility in handling different types of data and queries by allowing developers to choose the most suitable summarization strategy for their use case.
