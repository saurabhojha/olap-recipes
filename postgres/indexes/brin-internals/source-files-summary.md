The [BRIN (Block Range Index) subsystem](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/master/src/backend/access/brin) in PostgreSQL implements a space-efficient indexing method for very large tables. Let me walk you through the directory file by file, summarizing the purpose of each:

---

### 📘 `README`
This document provides a comprehensive overview of how BRIN indexes work. Key points include:
- BRIN indexes summarize ranges of heap pages using "summary tuples" rather than indexing individual rows.
- Summary tuples hold min/max values or other aggregate representations.
- Efficient for large, append-only tables where data is naturally ordered.
- Trade-off: faster index creation and lower space usage vs. slightly slower lookups.

---

### 🧱 `brin.c`
This is the core file that implements the BRIN access method. It handles:
- Index building and scanning.
- Tuple insertion and summarization.
- Delegates to operator classes for column-specific logic.

---

### 🌸 `brin_bloom.c`
Implements a bloom filter based BRIN operator class. It's ideal when data distribution is sparse and not naturally clustered.
- Stores bloom filters as summary representations.
- Efficient at excluding pages unlikely to contain matching rows.

---

### 📐 `brin_inclusion.c`
Implements the *inclusion* BRIN operator class.
- Tracks if values fall within a certain range.
- Works well for geometric or interval data.

---

### 📉 `brin_minmax.c`
Implements the basic *minmax* operator class.
- Stores minimum and maximum values for each block range.
- Simple and efficient, best for data with natural ordering.

---

### 🧬 `brin_minmax_multi.c`
Advanced version of minmax that supports multiple min/max values.
- Better for datasets with outliers or varying distributions.
- More accurate than basic minmax, but uses more space.

---

### 🧾 `brin_pageops.c`
Handles low-level page operations:
- Inserting and deleting tuples.
- Managing page layout and compaction within BRIN pages.

---

### 🧭 `brin_revmap.c`
Implements the reverse map:
- Maps heap block ranges to index summary tuples.
- Supports efficient updates and scans.

---

### 📦 `brin_tuple.c`
Handles the structure and manipulation of BRIN tuples:
- Tuple creation, serialization, and comparison.
- Utilities for working with nulls and operator-specific values.

---

### 🧪 `brin_validate.c`
Validation functions for BRIN operator classes.
- Ensures operator classes implement required callbacks (like `addValue`, `union`, etc.).

---

### 🔄 `brin_xlog.c`
Adds support for write-ahead logging (WAL) for BRIN indexes.
- Ensures durability and crash recovery.

---

### 🛠 `Makefile` and `meson.build`
Build configuration files:
- Define how BRIN-related C files are compiled.
- Support `make` and `meson` build systems.
